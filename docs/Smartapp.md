# Smart Apps Setup

## Overview

The Smart Apps Setup for RF++ involves defining the necessary MTF  parameters to ensure smooth operation. This setup includes the execution of a script to create up to 5,000 devices, identified by IDs ranging from SM00001 to SM05000. By pre-creating these device IDs, the system avoids frequent task restarts, streamlining the registration process and ensuring efficient device management.
