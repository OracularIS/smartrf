**Taking your RF screens to the next level** 

All JDA/ Blue Yonder (BY) WMS implementations need an RF Solution - a solution for the physical devices that are used on the floor to perform most of the warehouse functions. Smart RF Plus application provides several enhancements for your existing RF screens. We provide an Android app that builds on top of the standard JDA/ BY solution, thus providing support for delivered, as well as custom RF screens without any extra work.
