# Smart RF Plus <small>

- **Taking your RF screens to the next level** All JDA/ Blue Yonder (BY) WMS implementations need an RF Solution - a solution for the physical devices that are used on the floor to perform most of the warehouse functions. Smart ISâ€™s RF++ application provides several enhancements for your existing RF screens. We provide an Android app that builds on top of the standard JDA/ BY solution, thus providing support for delivered, as well as custom RF screens without any extra work.
